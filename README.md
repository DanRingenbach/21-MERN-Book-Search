# 21-MERN-Book-Search

## Description
For this project I was given the front end and most of the back end of a book tracking full stack application.  My role was to complete the back-end of this application by making it use *GraphQL* as oppossed to *REST API*.  I did so by using *Express*, *Mongodb*, *GraphQL* and *Mongoose*.
